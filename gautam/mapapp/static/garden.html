        <h3>Chinese Garden is a park in Jurong East, Singapore. Built in 1975 by the JTC Corporation, the Chinese Garden's concept is based on Chinese gardening art.  The main characteristic is the integration of architectural features with the natural environment. The Chinese Garden is modelled along the northern Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping. It is located next to Chinese Garden MRT station and connected to the adjacent Japanese Garden by two bridges. Along with Japanese Garden and Lakeside Gardens, which was opened in 2019, the three gardens are collectively known as the Jurong Lake Gardens.</h3>
